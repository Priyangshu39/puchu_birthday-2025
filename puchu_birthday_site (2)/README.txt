Interactive Birthday Site - Instructions
---------------------------------------

This bundle contains a small interactive 3-step birthday experience:
1) Page 1 - Candles: "Blow" to extinguish candles. (Adds Next button)
2) Page 2 - Cake: "Cut Cake" to play the birthday song and show the final button.
3) Page 3 - Gallery & Wish: shows photos and the heartfelt wish.

Files included:
- index.html
- styles.css
- script.js
- 7 image files (photos)
- README.txt

Audio (optional):
- To enable sounds, place these files in the same folder as index.html:
  - blow.mp3      (a short blowing-out sound)
  - cake_cut.mp3  (a short celebratory sound when cake is cut)
  - song.mp3      (birthday background music; it will loop when started)

Preview locally:
- Unzip and open index.html in your browser.
- For audio, add the mp3 files as named above. If no mp3 provided, site still works without sound.
- To publish on GitHub Pages: upload all files to your repo and enable Pages in repo settings (branch main, / root).

If you'd like, I can help further with:
- selecting royalty-free audio and adding it to the bundle
- customizing fonts, teddy stickers, or animations further
