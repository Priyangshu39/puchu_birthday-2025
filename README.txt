Happy Birthday Puchu - Static Website Bundle
--------------------------------------------

Files included:
- index.html
- styles.css
- script.js
- (7 image files you uploaded)

How to preview locally:
1. Unzip the folder and open 'index.html' in your browser.
2. To add background music: place a file named 'song.mp3' in the same folder (index.html will load it automatically).
   - If you have a Spotify/YouTube link instead, you can replace the audio area in index.html with an iframe embed (I can show how if you want).

How to publish on GitHub Pages:
1. Create a new GitHub repo (public) named e.g. 'puchu-birthday'.
2. Upload all files to the repo (or push with git).
3. In GitHub repo settings -> Pages, set source to 'main' branch / root. The site will be live at: https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>/

If you'd like, I can generate a ready-to-upload ZIP file for you.
